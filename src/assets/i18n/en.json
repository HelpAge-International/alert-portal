Choosing both scenarios for each hazard ensures that the demands of a larger event are effectively planned for (worst case scenario) as well as the requirements for responding to the event you are most likely going to respond to (most likely scenario). For chronic threats such as conflict and food insecurity a “most likely” and “worst case” scenario approach may not be effective. Instead an intensification approach using a timeline may be preferable; where a worsening situation requiring ongoing expansion of operations over time is defined and allows planning for an evolving crisis. It is important to recognise that the situation will not be static but will change over the 4-6 weeks of initial response.

If the risk is only related to their separated or unaccompanied status, see category (Unaccompanied and seperated child). Unaccompanied and separated child: A boy or a girl under the age of 18 who is currently not under the care of either parent or other previous legal or customary primary caregiver. Separated children are those boys and girls separated from both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary caregiver, but not necessarily from other relatives. Separated children may therefore include boys and girls accompanied by other adult family members. Unaccompanied children are children who have been separated from both parents and or other relatives and who are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so. Persons with disabilities: Adult or Child who is physically or mentally impaired by illness, injury or wounds which hinders the normal day to day activity and needs to be addressed to allow the person to function normally. Older person at risk: Male or female, 60 years of age or older. Often, older asylum-seekers have been separated from their usual caregivers. They may also suffer from health problems and/or have difficulty adjusting to their new environment and knowing where to seek assistance. Important Medical condition: For individuals under the care and treatment of a medical doctor with conditions that may affect the identification of a durable solution (both positively and negatively) and the requirement of additional assistance in the country of asylum (both for treatment and nutritional and non-food items). In case of disability use the 'Persons with disabilities' category. Single parent: Single-parent household (Male or female 18 or older) with one or more dependents, all of whom are under the age of 18, in which the Head of Household (or Principal Applicant) is both the primary income earner and care provider. If the single parent is under age 18, use the 'Child at risk' or 'Unaccompanied and seperated child' categories. Woman at risk: Women who face protection risks particular to their gender, whether they are single heads of families, widowed, unaccompanied girls or accompanied by a male family member, as well as women that are survivors of violence. Protection problems include expulsion, refoulement and other security threats, sexual violence, physical abuse, intimidation, torture, economic hardship or marginalization, lack of integration prospects, community hostility, and different forms of exploitation. If under age 18, use the 'Child at risk' or 'Unaccompanied and seperated child' wherever possible instead. Pregnant or lactating: A temporary status to highlight medical assistance, nutritional enhancement or material requirements for women or girls during period of pregnancy or lactation. Specific legal and physical protection needs: Persons not falling into the other categories but who have specific needs within the particular context (e.g., survivors of torture or violence, members of a particular ethnic or religious group, or other protection concerns). Either male or female. If under age 18, use the 'Child at risk' or 'Unaccompanied and seperated child' wherever possible instead."

To raise awareness of distribution schedules and locations and the effective use of any resources provided.

Emergency Response Teamss should work with colleagues involved in community based DRR projects and alike to develop relationships with community groups who can provide an input into the planning process.

Conflict indicators may show sudden extreme variations. Periods of daily monitoring may be required for example during potential triggering events such as election periods. o        Does the risk have a seasonal driver – for example monitoring for cyclones or floods outside the season may be deemed unnecessary. However, agencies should choose an early date to begin seasonal monitoring in case there is an early occurrence. Since weather forecasts are updated several times a day, daily monitoring might be appropriate during high season for extreme events.  o        The availability of new information – if cyclone track information is updated every 6-12 hours, it would be appropriate to monitor this frequently once a storm has formed in the region.
