        <li>All Project Reporting Forms should be submitted by or on behalf of the the Project Lead.</li>
        <li>Please enter all text in <strong>Arial, size 10 font.</strong></li>
        <li>The suggested length for the basic data and narrative is 4-5 pages. When entering information longer than one line of text into a single cell, the text will wrap automatically. However, the row height will not automatically adjust to fit. <strong>Please adjust row heights manually to ensure all entered text is visible on the page.</strong> (To adjust row heights manually, hover the cursor over the line between two rows on the left-hand side of the page until it becomes a double-arrow, and then click and drag to adjust up and down.)</li>
        <li>The responses from your application have been linked to your reporting form where applicable. You can also find your original application in the previous worksheet for reference when filling out the report. <strong>Where possible please give greater detail when reporting as was supplied in the application form</strong> (eg, "Which vulnerable groups were specifically targeted within the crisis affected populations?").</li>
        <li><strong>Where applicable, please explain answers that are different from your application and why your approach changed during implementation</strong> (eg, "Explain how you sourced your goods").</li>
        <li>In cells whose response requires input of numbers, <strong>only whole numbers are accepted.</strong></li>
        <li>In the Activity Report worksheet, ten lines have been provided for listing different types of activities. This is copied from your application form. <strong>If you need more space, please attach as annexes.</strong> </li>
        <li>In the Budget Report worksheet, please give as much detail as you are able. If you are unable to provide a final, verified expenditure report by the report deadline, please provide a tentative one and give an indication of when you will send the final, verified financial report.</li>

        <li><strong>Needs assessment:</strong> You were not required to complete a separate needs assessment for this project, but please provide details of the most relevant assessment to which this project responded.</li>
        <li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> The M&E Team will use your answer to identify learning that can be shared and further developed and may follow-up with you directly for more details in some cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Documentation:</strong> You are encouraged to submit visual documentation (e.g. photos, videos) with your reporting form as this is highly valued for case studies and communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Beneficiary Influence:</strong> If beneficiaries have not been substantially involved in the project, please explain why the context prevented this.</li>
        <li><strong>The one-percent:</strong> See technical guidance on the application form (worksheet 1) for more information about the 1% learning budget and the simple process for accessing and reporting on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Peer-review:</strong> Reports will be submitted to the Learning and Evaluation Committee for peer-review by Start Fund agencies, and the M&E Team may contact you directly with any follow-up questions.</li>
