      <p>7. What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of my information? </p>
      <p>When you give the ALERT platform personal information we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) may be transmitted normally over the Internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, the ALERT platform cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, the ALERT platform is committed to taking reasonable steps to ensure its security on our systems. The ALERT platform is hosted on Google Firebase which uses various security measures in order to prevent loss, misuse or alteration of data. The Security Measures include measures to encrypt personal data; to help ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Google's systems and services; to help restore timely access to personal data following an incident; and for regular testing of effectiveness. Google may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Services. </p>
      <p>If Google becomes aware of a Data Incident, Google will: (a) notify Customer of the Data Incident promptly and without undue delay after becoming aware of the Data Incident; and (b) promptly take reasonable steps to minimise harm and secure Customer Data. Notifications made pursuant to this section will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Data Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Google recommends Customer take to address the Data Incident. </p>
      <p>In the event the ALERT team receives such notification, this will be forwarded on to all users of the platform, including all details of the data incident. </p>
      <p>8. Does the ALERT platform use cookies on its website? </p>
      <p>Yes. Cookies are pieces of information that are sent to your computer by the ALERT platform when you log on to our website. They are stored on your computer's hard drive, allowing us to recognise you as a user when you next visit. </p>

      <p>9. Does the ALERT platform review its privacy policy? </p>
